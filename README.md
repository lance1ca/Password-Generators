<p>This was a quick simple project demonstrating Java, Python, and C# skills to create a randomly generated password based on user inputs. Passwords are important, and it is even more important to make sure you have a strong password that will be used across multiple devices.</p>

<p>This is why I created 3 different programs in 3 different languages which all do the same thing. They ask a user for a specified number of normal alphabetical characters, special characters, and numbers. Then, the program generates a randomly selected password based on those characteristics using the ASCII chart. After this password is created, for an added level of security and randomization, the program then shuffles the password before displaying the newly created password back to the user.</p>
